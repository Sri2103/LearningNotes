# F.L.A.S.H. — Fail Fast Learning Loop

A rapid feedback framework to learn quickly by breaking, analyzing, adjusting, systemizing, and retesting.

---

## 1. FAIL — Identify the Breakpoint

Capture the failure immediately and objectively.

### Template

Trigger:  
Context:  
Expected:  
Actual:  
Impact:

---

## 2. LOCATE — Find the Fault Line

Identify the specific cause using the three-fault model:

- Broken Decision
- Broken Assumption
- Broken System

---

## 3. ADAPT — Apply an Immediate Patch

Define a small, actionable behavior change to prevent repetition.

### Format

If <situation occurs again>,  
I will <new micro-behavior>,  
so that <corrected outcome>.

---

## 4. SYSTEMIZE — Add a Lightweight Guardrail

Select one structural reinforcement that builds consistency:

- Checklist
- Rule or Constraint
- Automation
- Environmental Change

**Goal:** Rely on systems, not willpower.

---

## 5. HIT AGAIN — Re-test Quickly

Plan a re-run of the improved behavior to validate the fix.

**Template**

Next Test:  
New Behavior:  
Success Indicator:  
Status: Pending / Passed / Retest Needed

---

## Summary Loop

Fail → Locate → Adapt → Systemize → Hit Again → Upgrade

## Examples

```code
# F.L.A.S.H. Entry — API Deadline Missed

## 1. What Went Wrong

What I tried: Finish the API feature in one stretch.
What happened: Missed the deadline.
What I expected: Complete it on time.

## 2. Why It Happened

Main reason: I underestimated how long testing + refactoring would take.

## 3. What I Will Change

Next time, I will: Break the work into smaller chunks and review progress at mid-point.
So that: I catch delays early, not at the last moment.

## 4. Simple Support

What small helper will I add?
Create a midpoint progress check reminder at 50% of the timeline.

## 5. Try Again Soon

Next situation: Next sprint task with a 2–3 day timeline.
Success sign: Task is delivered with buffer time and no last-minute rush.
```

```code

# F.L.A.S.H. Entry — Slept at 2 AM Again

## 1. What Went Wrong
What I tried: Finish watching videos then sleep.
What happened: Ended up sleeping at 2 AM.
What I expected: Sleep at 11 PM.

## 2. Why It Happened
Main reason: I kept my phone next to me in bed, making it easy to continue watching.

## 3. What I Will Change
Next time, I will: Put the phone outside the bedroom before 10:30 PM.
So that: I reduce the temptation to keep watching.

## 4. Simple Support
What small helper will I add?
Set a 10:20 PM alarm named “Phone out of room.”

## 5. Try Again Soon
Next situation: Tonight.
Success sign: I am in bed by 11 PM with no phone.

```

```code
# F.L.A.S.H. Entry — Couldn't Focus on LeetCode Problem

## 1. What Went Wrong
What I tried: Solve a new problem after a long day.
What happened: Mind wandered and I gave up.
What I expected: 30 minutes of focused study.

## 2. Why It Happened
Main reason: I started without a clear plan or warm-up.

## 3. What I Will Change
Next time, I will: Begin with a 5-minute warm-up (reviewing one past problem).
So that: My mind enters problem-solving mode gradually.

## 4. Simple Support
What small helper will I add?
Keep a “Warm-up problem list” pinned in my notes.

## 5. Try Again Soon
Next situation: Tomorrow’s evening study session.
Success sign: Was able to focus for at least 30 minutes.
