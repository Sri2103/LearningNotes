# DSA Learning Framework

## 1. Why Am I Learning DSA?

> To build problem-solving intuition, clear thinking, and confidence for interviews and real-world system design.

## 2. Subskills (Decomposition)

- Patterns (Sliding Window, Two Pointers, DP...)
- Data structures (Stack, Heap, Trie, Graph)
- Algorithm design
- Complexity thinking
- Dry-running
- Pseudocode writing
- Debugging
- Pattern recognition

## 3. Knowledge Map

- Fundamentals → Complexity, arrays, hashmaps
- Core Patterns → Sliding Window, Two Pointers, BFS/DFS, Stack, Prefix Sum
- Advanced → Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, Union-Find, Graph Algorithms

## 4. Core Resources

Books:

- Grokking Algorithms
- Cracking the Coding Interview

Courses:

- NeetCode
- AlgoExpert (optional)

YouTube:

- NeetCode
- Abdul Bari

## 5. Learning Method (Meta Loop)

Learn → Apply → Reflect → Add to Playbook → Revise Flashcards

## 6. Practice Plan

- 2–3 problems per pattern
- Rotate patterns weekly
- Reflect after each problem

## 7. My DSA Playbook (Steps for Every Problem)

1. Restate the problem
2. Identify constraints
3. Classify pattern
4. Pick strategy
5. Dry-run with small input
6. Write pseudocode
7. Implement
8. Test edge cases
9. Extract insight to playbook

## 8. Mistakes to Avoid

- Jumping to code
- Memorizing solutions
- Ignoring constraints
- Skipping dry-runs

## 9. Reflection
