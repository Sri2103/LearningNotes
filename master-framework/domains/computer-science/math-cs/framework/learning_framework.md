# Algorithms & Math Foundations Learning Framework

## 1. Why am I learning this?

> To gain deep problem-solving ability, master algorithmic thinking, and understand the math behind efficient computation.

## 2. Subskills (Decomposition)

### Algorithms

- complexity analysis
- sorting & searching
- data structures
- greedy, DP, backtracking
- graph algorithms
- strings
- computational geometry

### Math Foundations

- number theory
- combinatorics
- probability
- recurrence relations
- linear algebra basics
- discrete math (sets, relations, graphs)

## 3. Knowledge Map

Fundamentals → complexity, arrays, math basics  
Intermediate → graph theory, DP, number theory  
Advanced → combinatorics, probability, linear algebra, advanced DP

## 4. Core Resources

Books:

- CLRS
- Algorithms (Sedgewick)
- Introduction to Algorithms with Python
- Concrete Mathematics

Courses:

- MIT 6.006
- MIT 6.042 (math for CS)
- Stanford Algorithms

## 5. Learning Method

Understand → model → prove → code → optimize → repeat

## 6. Practice Plan

Daily: 3–4 problems  
Weekly: one full topic  
Monthly: mock contest or timed test

## 7. Algorithms Playbook

1. Identify category (graph, DP, math, greedy, search)
2. Determine constraints
3. Consider brute force
4. Optimize to O(n log n) or O(n)
5. Check edge cases
6. Validate with examples
7. Refactor

## 8. Math Playbook

- Recognize patterns
- Derive recurrence
- Apply closed forms
- Use modular arithmetic
- Use probability distributions
- Work with combinatorics

## 9. Common Mistakes

- Incorrect complexity estimates
- Overcomplicating brute force
- Incorrect recurrence definitions
- Forgetting modulo operations
- Wrong base cases in DP
