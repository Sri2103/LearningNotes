- Pods, Deployments, ReplicaSets
- Services & networking
- Storage
- Scheduling
- RBAC & security
- Helm & Kustomize

- Troubleshooting

## 3. Knowledge Map

Fundamentals → Pods, Deployments, Services

## 5. Learning Method

Explore → Build → Break → Fix → Document → Automate

## 6. Practice Plan

Daily: 20–30 mins labs  
Weekly: 1 new concept + 1 project  
Monthly: 1 advanced scenario

## 7. Kubernetes Playbook (Steps)

1. Understand resource purpose
2. Check YAML structure
3. Know key fields
4. Apply manifest
5. Validate with `kubectl`
6. Observe events/logs
7. Debug using describe/logs
8. Document patterns
