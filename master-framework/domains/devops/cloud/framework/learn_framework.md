# Cloud Computing Learning Framework

## 1. Why am I learning cloud computing?

> To deploy scalable, reliable, cost-efficient applications using managed cloud infrastructure.

## 2. Subskills (Decomposition)

- Compute (VMs, containers, serverless)
- Storage (object, block, file)
- Networking (VPC, load balancing, peering)
- Identity & security (IAM, policies)
- Databases (SQL/NoSQL)
- Messaging (queues, pub/sub)
- Managed services
- Observability
- Infrastructure as Code
- Automation
- Cloud cost management
- Multi-region architecture

## 3. Knowledge Map

Fundamentals → compute, storage, network  
Intermediate → IAM, VPC, LB, autoscaling  
Advanced → HA, DR, IaC automation, multi-region systems

## 4. Core Resources

Books:

- Cloud Architecture Patterns
- Cloud Native Patterns
- The Phoenix Project (mindset)

Courses:

- AWS/GCP/Azure Architect tracks
- Kubernetes + Terraform

## 5. Learning Method

Concept → architecture → lab → diagram → automate

## 6. Practice Plan

Daily: 1 cloud concept  
Weekly: build a small cloud architecture  
Monthly: deploy a full project

## 7. Cloud Architecture Playbook

1. Define functional requirements
2. Define non-functional requirements (SLA, HA)
3. Choose compute model
4. Define VPC/networking
5. Choose database/storage
6. Add load balancing + autoscaling
7. Add observability
8. Add security + IAM
9. Add DR/multi-region if needed
10. Optimize costs

## 8. Common Mistakes

- Choosing wrong compute model (VM for serverless apps)
- Over-provisioning instances
- Ignoring IAM best practices
- Not using autoscaling
- No monitoring or alerts
