# Cloud Computing Mistake Log

## Common Mistakes I've Made

- Misconfigured VPC
- Public resources left open
- No autoscaling configured
- Wrong storage tier chosen
- No monitoring on critical components
- Not defining IAM boundaries
- Storing sensitive data incorrectly

## Fix Strategy

- Always isolate subnets
- Follow least-privilege IAM
- Use IaC so configs are reproducible
- Enable cost alerts
