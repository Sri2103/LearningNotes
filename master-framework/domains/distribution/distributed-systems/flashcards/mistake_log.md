# Distributed Systems Mistake Log

## Common Mistakes I've Made

- Assuming time is reliable
- Thinking consensus = fast
- Overusing strong consistency
- Forgetting write amplification
- Misusing quorums
- Ignoring slow nodes
- Not testing partitions

## Fix Strategy

- Test with chaos tools
- Revisit CAP
- Build simulations
- Explicitly model timeouts
