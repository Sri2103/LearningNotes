# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Learning Framework

## 1. Why am I learning ML/DL?

> To understand predictive modeling, deep architectures, AI fundamentals, and to build production-ready ML systems and intelligent applications.

## 2. Subskills (Decomposition)

### Foundations

- probability
- statistics
- linear algebra
- calculus
- optimization

### Classical ML

- regression
- classification
- clustering
- dimensionality reduction
- evaluation metrics

### Deep Learning

- retraining pipelines

## 3. Knowledge Map

Fundamentals → ML basics  
Intermediate → deep learning architectures  
Advanced → generative models, transformers, MLOps

## 4. Core Resources

Books:

- Deep Learning (Goodfellow)
- Pattern Recognition & ML (Bishop)
- Hands-On ML with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow

Courses:

- Andrew Ng ML
- CS231n
- CS224n
- FastAI

## 5. Learning Method

Math → implement → train small models → evaluate → build bigger models → deploy

## 6. Practice Plan

Daily: 1 ML concept or notebook  
Weekly: 1 model implementation  
Monthly: 1 full project

## 7. ML Playbook

1. Understand the data
2. Choose baseline model
3. Apply correct preprocessing
4. Train simple model
5. Tune hyperparameters
6. Add regularization
7. Deploy
8. Monitor

## 8. Deep Learning Playbook

- start small
- use good initialization
- use learning rate scheduling
- monitor gradients
- avoid overfitting with augmentation
- use GPU efficiently

## 9. Common Mistakes

- training without normalization
- bad train/val split
- not checking data leakage
- wrong loss functions
- overfitting due to small data
