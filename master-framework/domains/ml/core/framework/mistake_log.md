# ML & DL Mistake Log

## Common Mistakes I've Made

- training on unnormalized data
- using wrong loss (e.g., MSE for classification)
- data leakage in splitting
- overfitting with small models
- not checking gradient explosion
- misunderstanding softmax outputs
- forgetting dropout in training

## Fix Strategy

- always inspect dataset
- use correct metrics
- visualize learning curves
- test on real unseen data
