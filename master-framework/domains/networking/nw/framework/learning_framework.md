# Networking Learning Framework

## 1. Why am I learning networking?

> To understand how data moves across systems, build reliable networked applications, troubleshoot APIs/services, and master backend/DevOps fundamentals.

## 2. Subskills (Decomposition)

- OSI & TCP/IP models
- IP addressing & subnetting
- TCP/UDP internals
- Routing & switching
- DNS, HTTP, TLS
- Load balancing
- Firewalls/NAT
- Sockets programming
- Packet flow
- Performance tuning

## 3. Knowledge Map

Fundamentals → OSI, IP, routing basics  
Intermediate → TCP internals, DNS, HTTP  
Advanced → congestion control, TLS handshake, socket tuning

## 4. Core Resources

Books:

- Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach
- TCP/IP Illustrated
- High Performance Browser Networking

Courses:

- Stanford CS144
- Georgia Tech Networking

## 5. Learning Method

Model → Visualize → Packet capture → Debug → Document

## 6. Practice Plan

Daily: analyze 1–2 packets  
Weekly: network labs  
Monthly: deep protocol dive

## 7. Networking Playbook

1. Identify layer (L1–L7)
2. Understand header fields
3. Follow packet path
4. Check routing & DNS
5. Check TCP handshake & flags
6. Analyze latency/RTT
7. Identify bottleneck
8. Document flow

## 8. Common Mistakes

- Confusing TCP vs UDP
- Ignoring DNS
- Misunderstanding MTU/MSS
- Thinking “HTTP = TCP”
