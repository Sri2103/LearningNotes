# CPU Architecture Mistake Log

## Common Mistakes I've Made

- Thinking CPU = sequential
- Forgetting pipeline stages
- Misinterpreting spec vs impl
- Confusing branch prediction with caching
- Ignoring TLB impact
- Assuming multi-core always improves speed

## Fix Strategy

- Draw diagrams instead of reading
- Simulate pipelines
- Read assembly output regularly
