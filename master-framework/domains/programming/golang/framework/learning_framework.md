# Golang Learning Framework

## 1. Why am I learning Golang?

> To build production-ready backend services, APIs, microservices, and concurrency-based systems reliably.

## 2. Subskills (Decomposition)

- Syntax & fundamentals
- Types, structs, methods
- Interfaces & design
- Concurrency (goroutines, channels)
- Error handling
- HTTP servers
- Testing
- Memory model & performance
- File I/O
- Modules & dependency management

## 3. Knowledge Map

- Fundamentals → variables, slices, maps, loops
- Intermediate → methods, interfaces, JSON, testing
- Advanced → concurrency, sync, channels, contexts
- System → building APIs, microservices, CLI apps

## 4. Core Resources

Books:

- “The Go Programming Language”
- “100 Go Mistakes”

Courses:

- Tour of Go
- Go by Example
- Ardan Labs Courses

## 5. Learning Method

Learn → Write code → Debug → Benchmark → Document → Reflect

## 6. Practice Plan

Daily: 30 mins coding  
Weekly: 1 tiny project  
Monthly: 1 bigger project

## 7. My Golang Playbook Steps

1. Understand the problem/use case
2. Identify what Go standard library offers
3. Write a minimal working version
4. Optimize & clean code
5. Add concurrency only if required
6. Add tests
7. Document & reflect

## 8. Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Overusing channels
- Avoiding interfaces
- Fighting the compiler
- Forgetting `err` handling
- Misusing goroutines

## 9. Reflection
