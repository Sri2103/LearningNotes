# Security & Cryptography Learning Framework

## 1. Why am I learning this?

> To understand how systems are attacked, how to defend them, how cryptography protects data, and how to build secure applications and architectures.

## 2. Subskills (Decomposition)

### Security

- core security principles
- threat modeling
- authentication & authorization
- secrets management
- web & API security
- cloud security
- network security
- secure coding
- DevSecOps

### Cryptography

- hashing
- symmetric encryption
- asymmetric encryption
- digital signatures
- certificates & PKI
- secure key exchange
- TLS & HTTPS

## 3. Knowledge Map

Fundamentals → cryptographic basics, OWASP  
Intermediate → PKI, TLS, auth, key exchange  
Advanced → secure design, zero-trust, cloud security, hardening

## 4. Core Resources

Books:

- Cryptography Engineering
- Applied Cryptography
- Web Application Hacker’s Handbook
- Security Engineering (Ross Anderson)

Courses:

- Stanford Cryptography I/II
- Offensive Security basics (optional)
- Cloud security specializations

## 5. Learning Method

Understand → model → break → defend → test → harden

## 6. Practice Plan

Daily: 1 security concept  
Weekly: 1 threat model or attack simulation  
Monthly: build secure architecture

## 7. Security Playbook

1. Identify assets
2. Identify threats
3. Identify attack surface
4. Apply least privilege
5. Validate with logs
6. Apply crypto where needed
7. Hardening + monitoring

## 8. Cryptography Playbook

- Hashing → integrity
- Symmetric → confidentiality
- Asymmetric → key exchange, signatures
- PKI → trust
- TLS → secure transport

## 9. Common Mistakes

- Rolling your own crypto
- Hardcoding secrets
- Using outdated hashing (MD5/SHA1)
- Not validating certificates
- Overtrusting client-side checks
