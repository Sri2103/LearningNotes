# Systems Design Learning Framework

## 1. Why am I learning System Design?

> To design scalable, reliable, fault-tolerant backend systems and improve architecture skills needed for interviews & real-world engineering.

## 2. Subskills (Decomposition)

- Requirements analysis
- Architecture thinking
- Databases (SQL/NoSQL)
- Caching
- Load balancing
- Message queues
- Distributed systems
- CAP theorem
- Microservices
- Scaling strategies
- Storage systems
- CDNs
- Observability
- Reliability engineering

## 3. Knowledge Map

Fundamentals → latency/throughput, load balancing, caching  
Intermediate → database sharding, replication, partitioning  
Advanced → consensus, distributed logs, leader election, microservices

## 4. Core Resources

Books:

- Designing Data-Intensive Applications (DDIA)
- System Design Interview Volume 1 & 2
- The Art of Scalability

Courses:

- Alex Xu System Design
- Educative Grokking the System Design Interview

## 5. Learning Method

Understand → Sketch → Evaluate → Optimize → Redesign

## 6. Practice Plan

Weekly: 2 system design scenarios  
Monthly: 1 end-to-end architecture document

## 7. System Design Playbook

1. Clarify requirements
2. Define constraints
3. Identify components
4. High-level architecture
5. Deep-dive into components
6. Scaling strategies
7. Bottlenecks analysis
8. Failures & HA design
9. Tradeoffs
10. Diagram & summary

## 8. Common Mistakes

- Skipping requirements
- Jumping into tech too early
- Overengineering
- Ignoring bottlenecks
- Forgetting HA/DR
- Not considering tradeoffs
