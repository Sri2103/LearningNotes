# Web Dev Mistake Log

## Common Mistakes I've Made

- mixing component logic & UI
- using too many states
- not memoizing expensive operations
- forgetting error handling
- missing database indexes
- returning huge payloads
- storing secrets in frontend

## Fix Strategy

- follow component hierarchy
- use services/utility layers
- use DTOs for API
- test endpoints
- separate environment config
